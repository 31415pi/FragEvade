You are a stick of RAM.
For some reason you're in a dream, flying through the dystopian cyberpunk sky.
Your job is to collect and store binary data.
There is only one monster so far. Its a memory fragmentation. One is internal. One is external. They strip you of points.
Binary data gives you points.
If you touch the bottom, you buffer underrun and die.
Good luck.
